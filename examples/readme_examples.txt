==============================================================================

This directory contains some sample configuration files which demonstrate
the parameter range for the scenarios.  There is one sample file for each
scenario.  Use the files with the '-i' option, see map_gen --help.

Since some parametrization examples drive the scenarios near their limits,
you might experience an increased risk for map generation failure.  If map
generation fails, simply try again.
