==============================================================================
Changes from map_gen 1.0 -> 1.1.0

There is not much to report from the user's point of view.
The main focus of 1.1.0 was on the Linux port and making the sources available.
The scenarios and their parameter sets have not changed substantially.


- The version number now complies to the standard <major>.<minor>.<patchlevel>.
  That's why the new version is 1.1.0 and not 1.1

- Sources are now included, this version is under GPL

- Development has been ported to Linux.  Map_gen runs now natively under Linux.
  A Windows executable is still included, of course.

- Some rare occuring bugs have been fixed

- Two new scenarios: "Volcano Islands" and "Desert".  In fact, they are
  not really new; they were already present in version 1.0, but I didn't
  mention them because they were not sufficiently tested at that time.

- The log file is no longer overwritten by default with every new run;
  it is appended to an existing log file instead.
  This is to avoid an inadvertent loss of a previous log file.
  Anyway, there is a new command line option '-a' to return to the version 1.0
  behaviour (overwriting the log file).

- More parametrization examples have been added, see map_gen-1.1.0\examples.
  I hope these examples help you to do your own parametrizations.
