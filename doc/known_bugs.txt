==============================================================================

- In the 'Mountains' scenario, the human player's starting valley has always
  two grassland tiles, never plains.  This is in contradiction to my own
  design rules (standard distribution of bonus resources and
  grasslands/plains).
  Anyway, without this bug the city might not be able to grow above size 5
  in early game.  With the bug, it is size 6.  Since the resources of the
  human player's starting city are already quite limited, I decided to
  leave the bug as it is for version 1.1.0.
  Easy to fix.


- The random number generator is reproducible across machines when suppling
  raw integer numbers, but not when supplying a specified range.  The reason
  is most likely double to integer conversion, which is obviously different
  on different hardware.

  I discovered this bug when I ran one of my testsuites.  It is a
  reproducability test where I generate maps with defined seeds across
  operating systems and machines and check for bitwise identity against
  reference maps.
  Hard to fix.  How do you control double to integer conversion?
  I'll have to re-design the function to use integer arithmetic only.


- On small maps of 'Hard fight' occur segmentation faults.  I discovered
  that after the code freeze for 1.1.0.  Since I believe no one will play
  Hard fight on small maps, I don't consider that to be a show stopper.
  Will be investigated before the next release.
