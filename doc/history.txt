The history of map_gen
======================

It all started in february 2006 when I had played a lot of games
on standard maps but never really needed to build a strong fleet
to win.  All I needed were some robust transport ships, just to hop to
the next continent.  Sometimes I didn't use ships at all, instead I used
transport planes.  I wondered how it would feel to play a game where
a strong fleet was  *essential*  to win the game.

Such a game would happen on a map where all players would start on
separate continents (resp. islands), with a distance between them so
large that even transport planes with five fuels could not return to
one's cities.  But standard maps never looked like that.

OK, C-Evo has a built-in editor, so I made a map like this and played it
but was a little disappointed because I remembered the map I made,
so I knew exactly where the other island were and hence I knew in
which directions I should send my ships.
What I missed was the thrill that you feel when you start a new game and
see nothing but a few tiles.

That was the birth of map_gen, which had only one scenario at that time:
'Navigation required'


Some milestones:
----------------
2007-May: Added 'Micronesia' scenario.  The idea was to still have
    a waterworld but to allow earlier contact so the human player
    could not be sure to be safe from attacks in early game.

2008-Mar: Added 'Mountains' scenario.  I like scenarios with limited resources.
    Moreover, 'Mountains' puts the human player in a disadvantage situation
    since he/she starts in a valley far from the other players.

    This was the first scenario with rivers.  It turned out to be quite
    complicated to make rivers run in a natural looking way.  I now use an
    elevation model in which each water tile is on sea level and land tiles
    are on higher levels.
    This is combined with a rain/erosion model.  Rain is falling down on land
    tiles and flowing down to adjacent tiles of lower elevation until it hits
    a water tile.  Each tile's elevation is lowered according to the quantity
    of water flowing thru the tile.  Surrounding tiles are lowered a bit, too.
    This attracts water from nearby tiles, so nearby rivers tend to merge
    together.  Several rain/flow/erosion cycles are performed to create the
    final river beds.

2008-Jul: Added 'Hard Fight' scenario.  I wanted a map where I *need* the
    strong units which are available in late game.  But on standard maps as
    well as on my previous scenarios, games were finished long before I really
    needed a defender with 945 defense value or a 2xxx-Missile Launcher.  When
    playing 'Hard Fight', you will need these.

2009-Jan: Implemented ini file mechanism.  Before that, each parameter change
    (and even a scenario switch) required a recompilation of map_gen.

    Also added the 'Arctic' scenario.  Not only starts the human player in a
    place with limited potential for growing his/her capitol, the surrounding
    tiles are hostile terrain, to make the situation even harder (when I
    designed 'Arctic', engineers were vulnerable by hostile terrain).  The only
    way out was by ship or by plane (or building a lot of military bases ;-).

2010-Jun: First thought of making map_gen public domain one day.  Wrote my own
    random number generator (RNG) to have full control of the random number
    sequence.  Meaning was to get rid of DLL dependencies.  RNG algorithms in
    DLLs on other computers could easily generate a different sequence for the
    same seed, which would make it impossible to reproduce problems which might
    occur on someone else's computer.

2012-Feb: Added 'Big River' scenario.  Started as a 1:1 scenario, with one
    player on each side of the river.  Big land mass for both players.  To
    attack, one must build transport ships (or planes).  Topologically similar
    to 'Navigation required', but with more land mass.  You can think of the
    north and south side as of two islands.

2012-Jun: Added 'Great Plains' scenario.  A scenario made for fast and strong
    attackers (horsemen, dragoons, cavalry): No heavy terrain => Attackers do
    not waste their movement points, and defenders get no terrain bonus.

2013-Apr: Used an automatic testing environment to generate a lot of maps.
    Found and eliminated some rare-occuring bugs.

2016-Jul: Release of version 1.0

2017-Apr: Release of version 1.1.0 (Linux port, licensed under GPL)
